About
=====

This is a library implementing an RSS/Podcast feed generator for the Go programming
language (http://golang.org/).

RSS (Rich Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication) is a data format used to
publish frequently updated works - such as blog entries, news headlines, audio
and video - in a standardized format. Podcasts utilize this format to deliver audio and video files and assiciated metadata.

An RSS document (which is called a "feed", "web feed", or "channel") includes
full or summarized text, plus metadata such as publishing dates and authorship.
